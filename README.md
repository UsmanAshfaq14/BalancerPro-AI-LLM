# BalancerPro-AI Case Study

## Overview

**BalancerPro-AI** is an intelligent system designed to analyze server workloads and provide optimal process distribution to prevent performance bottlenecks. In simple terms, it reviews how busy each server is and suggests how to shift tasks so that no server becomes overwhelmed. The system accepts data in CSV or JSON formats, checks the data against strict rules, and then performs clear, step-by-step calculations. These calculations help determine whether a server is overloaded and, if so, exactly how many processes should be moved to a less busy server. The entire process is explained in plain language, making it accessible even for non-technical users.

## Metadata

- **Project Name:** BalancerPro-AI  
- **Version:** 1.0.0  
- **Author:** Usman Ashfaq  
- **Keywords:** Server Workload, Load Balancing, Data Validation, Process Distribution, Performance Optimization

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  - **Format Enforcement:** Accepts only CSV or JSON data enclosed in markdown code blocks.  
  - **Required Fields:** Ensures every server record contains:
    - `server_id`
    - `cpu_usage_percent`
    - `memory_usage_percent`
    - `active_processes`
  - **Value Checks:** CPU and memory percentages must be between 0 and 100, and process counts cannot be negative.  
  - **Error Handling:** If any issue is found (like missing fields or out-of-range values), the system returns a clear error message with an example of valid input.

- **Step-by-Step Calculations:**  
  For each server record, the system calculates:
  - **Average Usage:** Finds the average CPU and memory usage across all servers.
  - **Workload Score:** Uses a formula that weighs CPU usage at 60% and memory usage at 40% to get a score.
  - **Process Redistribution:** Determines how many processes need to be moved from overloaded servers to those with lower workloads.
  - **Zone Classification:** Classifies servers into:
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Red Zone:** CPU or memory is 80% or higher.
    - üü° **Yellow Zone:** CPU or memory is between 60% and 79%.
    - ‚úÖ **Green Zone:** Both CPU and memory are below 60%.

- **User Interaction and Feedback:**  
  - **Customized Greetings:** Special greetings for urgent issues or based on the time of day.
  - **Detailed Reporting:** Outputs a summary table with key metrics and a clear redistribution plan.
  - **Feedback Request:** At the end of every analysis, the system asks for a rating (from 1 to 5 stars) to ensure continuous improvement.

## Variations and Test Flows

Below are real-world scenarios (flows) demonstrating how BalancerPro-AI works. These flows illustrate data submissions, error handling, and the system‚Äôs detailed responses.

---

### Flow 1: XML Format Rejection Flow

- **User Action:**  
  The user submits server data in XML format:
  ```xml
  <server id="srv1">
    <cpu>90%</cpu>
    <memory>85</memory>
    <processes>45</processes>
  </server>
  ```
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system replies with a greeting and a strict error message:
  > ‚öñÔ∏è Greetings! I'm BalancerPro-AI. Provide server data in CSV/JSON to balance workloads. Need a template? Just ask!  
  >  
  > ‚ùå ERROR: Invalid format. Use ```csv or ```json code blocks.  
  >  
  > *Example valid entry:*
  > ```csv
  > server_id,cpu_usage_percent,memory_usage_percent,active_processes
  > string,0-100,0-100,number
  > ```
  >  
  > Please share server data in the correct format.

- **Outcome:**  
  The user is informed that XML is not acceptable, ensuring data consistency.

---

### Flow 2: JSON Data Analysis Flow

- **User Action:**  
  The user submits valid JSON data:
  ```json
  {
    "servers": [
      {"server_id": "nyc-01", "cpu_usage_percent": 95, "memory_usage_percent": 88, "active_processes": 60},
      {"server_id": "nyc-03", "cpu_usage_percent": 30, "memory_usage_percent": 25, "active_processes": 10}
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system validates the data and then provides detailed calculations:
  - **Summary:**  
    üìä Server Load Analysis  
    Total Servers: `2` | Avg CPU: `63%` | Avg Memory: `57%`  
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Red Zone: 1 server | ‚úÖ Green Zone: 1 server
  - **Calculations:**  
    - **Averages:**  
      - CPU_avg = `(95 + 30) √∑ 2 = 62.5 ‚Üí 63%`  
      - Memory_avg = `(88 + 25) √∑ 2 = 56.5 ‚Üí 57%`
    - **Workload Scores:**  
      - nyc-01: `(95 √ó 0.6) + (88 √ó 0.4) = 57 + 35.2 = 92.2`  
      - nyc-03: `(30 √ó 0.6) + (25 √ó 0.4) = 18 + 10 = 28`
    - **Process Redistribution:**  
      - Total processes = `60 + 10 = 70`  
      - Target per server = `70 √∑ 2 = 35`  
      - Action: Move `25 processes` from nyc-01 to nyc-03.
  - **Action Table & Plan:**  
    | Server  | CPU% | Memory% | Processes | Action                |  
    |---------|------|---------|-----------|-----------------------|  
    | nyc-01  | `95%`  | `88%`     | `60`        | Move 25 processes     |  
    | nyc-03  | `30%`  | `25%`     | `10`        | No action needed      |
  - **Feedback Prompt:**  
    Rate this solution (1-5 ‚òÖ):  
    ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ - Great solution  
    ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ - Needs improvement  
    ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ - Incomplete

- **Outcome:**  
  The system successfully analyzes the data and suggests moving 25 processes from the overloaded server (nyc-01) to the less loaded server (nyc-03).

---

### Flow 3: Urgent Overload Scenario (CSV Data)

- **User Action:**  
  The user sends a message indicating an urgent situation along with CSV data:
  ```csv
  server_id,cpu_usage_percent,memory_usage_percent,active_processes
  srv-101,85,90,70
  srv-102,40,35,20
  srv-103,50,45,30
  ```
  The message includes words like "urgent" and "overloaded."
- **Assistant Response:**  
  Because the message contains urgent keywords, the system responds with:
  > üî• BalancerPro-AI here! Let's stabilize your servers immediately!
  >  
  Followed by analysis:
  - **Summary:**  
    üìä Server Load Analysis  
    Total Servers: `3` | Avg CPU: `58%` | Avg Memory: `57%`  
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Red Zone: 1 server | ‚úÖ Green Zone: 2 servers
  - **Calculations (simplified):**  
    - **srv-101:** Overloaded with high CPU and memory usage.
    - **Process Redistribution:**  
      Total processes = `70 + 20 + 30 = 120`  
      Target per server = `120 √∑ 3 = 40`  
      - **Action:** Move `30 processes` from srv-101 to one or both of the other servers.
- **Outcome:**  
  The system uses the urgent greeting and clearly explains that processes need to be redistributed from the overloaded server.

---

### Flow 4: Mixed Data Submission (JSON with Multiple Servers)

- **User Action:**  
  The user submits a JSON file with data for three servers:
  ```json
  {
    "servers": [
      {"server_id": "eu-01", "cpu_usage_percent": 70, "memory_usage_percent": 65, "active_processes": 50},
      {"server_id": "eu-02", "cpu_usage_percent": 55, "memory_usage_percent": 60, "active_processes": 40},
      {"server_id": "eu-03", "cpu_usage_percent": 45, "memory_usage_percent": 50, "active_processes": 30}
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system validates and processes the data:
  - **Summary:**  
    üìä Server Load Analysis  
    Total Servers: `3` | Avg CPU: `57%` | Avg Memory: `58%`  
    üü° Yellow Zone: 1 server | ‚úÖ Green Zone: 2 servers
  - **Calculations:**  
    - **Workload Scores:** Computed individually for each server.
    - **Process Redistribution:**  
      Total processes = `50 + 40 + 30 = 120`  
      Target per server = `120 √∑ 3 = 40`  
      - **Action:** Recommend moving `10 processes` from eu-01 (if slightly overloaded) to balance the load.
- **Outcome:**  
  The system clearly communicates the status of each server and provides a balanced redistribution plan.

---

### Flow 5: Error Handling ‚Äì Out-of-Range Value (CSV Data)

- **User Action:**  
  The user submits CSV data with an out-of-range value:
  ```csv
  server_id,cpu_usage_percent,memory_usage_percent,active_processes
  srv-201,105,75,50
  srv-202,60,65,35
  ```
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system detects that the CPU usage for `srv-201` is 105%, which is outside the allowed range (0-100):
  > ‚ùå ERROR: Invalid % value. Values must be 0-100.
- **Outcome:**  
  The user is informed of the error so that they can correct the value and resubmit the data.
